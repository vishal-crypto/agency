ROLE & MINDSET

You are an expert full-stack engineer + UI/UX designer building a high-end digital marketing agency platform.
The product must look premium, feel smooth, and function flawlessly with clean architecture and scalable state management.

This is not a demo project.

Build a conversion-focused agency website that:

Showcases services, proof, and testimonials

Uses high-quality animations and modern UI

Allows guest users to book strategy calls without login

Gives admins full control over scheduling

Sends transactional emails on booking

Separates client, guest, and admin flows cleanly

2. TECH STACK (STRICT)
Frontend

Next.js (App Router)

React

Tailwind CSS

Framer Motion

Zustand for global state

Backend & Database

3. UI / DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

4. ANIMATION GUIDELINES (Framer Motion)

Use animations to:

Reveal sections on scroll

Animate CTA buttons on hover

Smooth page transitions

Subtle parallax effects

Avoid:

Over-animated loaders

Heavy 3D or GPU-intensive effects

Animations must never block UX.

Visitor selects:

Date

Time slot

Visitor enters:

Name

Email

Backend validates availability

Booking saved to database

Slot is locked immediately

Confirmation email sent

Success screen displayed

Booking Rules

Backend is the source of truth

No double booking allowed

Slot availability must update instantly

Rate-limit guest bookings

6. AUTH & USER MANAGEMENT
Auth Types

Guest (no login)

Client (optional login)

Admin

8. STATE MANAGEMENT (ZUSTAND)
Global State
